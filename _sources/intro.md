# 16SAmpliconKit 

Welcome to the 16SAmpliconKit documentation!

16SAmpliconKit is a reproducible and flexible computational pipeline designed to analyze Illumina amplicon sequencing data from any hypervariable region of the 16S rRNA gene. It takes raw Fastq files as input and, through a Snakemake workflow, automates QIIME 2-based processing â€” including quality control, denoising, primer trimming, feature table construction, and taxonomic classification. The pipeline supports large-scale, multi-bioproject meta-analyses and is ideal for comparative microbial community profiling across diverse environments.

This website will help you install and configure the workflow to apply it to your own data.
The webpage is built using Jupyter-book.
